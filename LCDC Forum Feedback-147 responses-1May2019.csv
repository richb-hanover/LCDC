What I thought was missing from the consultants report was a slide projecting what the demographics of the town look like if current trends hold.  If high education spending is driving out older residents and high education quality is attracting younger residents with school age children then what does the town look like in 10 years if nothing is done to change current trends?  What would the tax rate have to be to maintain school spending with 20% more kids?  Will the faction that wants no change like what they see in 10 years if we do nothing now?

Again, there is no single magic bullet, but we can attack this problem on multiple fronts.

1) Increase revenue by revisiting taxing of land in current use and conservation easement. 
I understand that is a Statewide issue, but it has an extremely large impact on our town. I agree with Rusty regarding the significant gaming of the tax system by some landowners in Lyme to offset their land taxes at the expense of the rest of us without large tracts of land.  The forestry argument is sock-puppetry to divert from addressing this underlying problem.  

1a) Having essentially all undeveloped land in current use/conservation easement means there will never be land available to put a cell tower in town.  Bravo, Lyme, on the self-inflicted wound keeping us stuck in the 1990s telecommunications-wise.

2) Renegotiate Hanover HS tuition.
A few years ago, Jeff Valence said there would be negotiations with the Dresden School district to address the very high tuition payments the town makes to send kids to HHS.  70% of Lyme HS kids now go to HHS, and that school has the HIGHEST public tuition in the state.  In addition, financial incentives need to be implemented to compel parents to send their kids to other schools.

3) Increase *realistic* commercial development. 
Consider making a list of what types of companies would be fine with no sewer or town water.  What companies would be fine with 3000 cars per day?  Look at nearby towns to the N/W/E of us that have similar limitations.  Gyms, nurseries (*cough* Menges' NIMBY *cough*), pop-up coffee shops, offices, used book stores.  I think the bar has been set too high in that people expect only top-tier, high quality commercial enterprises to come in, but it has to start organically, which will mean a little lower quality at first.  Let's not be too precious about ourselves here.

4) Increase revenue by adding aging-in-place communities. 
Continually changing the goalposts for getting the Pinnacle Project certified is absurd and shameful.  The pearl-clutching whaddaboutism and scaremongering of the Planning Board is farcical and embarrassing.  Seriously, I'd be fine if the Bailey's *voluntarily* cashed out their farm and we got more houses and businesses there.  Good for them.  That's the market at work.  Let's not hamstring our town because we want to see cute goats and turkeys on our commute home in the evening.

5) Increased commercially zoned locations in town.
West Thetford Road, Rte 10 North near Mill Gardens, near skiway, Rte 10 South of town.",,"Lyme is incredibly lucky a) to have very wealthy people living here and b) be located next to a major university and hospital.  Similar reasons are why Ithaca NY prospers in the middle of upstate New York (i.e. Cornell), while other towns on the Finger Lakes are dying.  So while we all say it's our town's esprit de corps that sets us apart, people think the same no matter where there are.  **Honestly** it's location and money.  And the money is here because of location.   Consider how town projects, big and small, are funded by the local super-wealthy (Lyme Fiber, new sheet for town ice rink, Lyme Foundation grants, etc.)  Lyme residents do a very good job on making this happen, and it needs to continue, and even be enhanced, as the town moves forward.   That doesn't address any of the tax issues I mention above, but I just want to highlight that it's a funding source that needs to be persistently utilized."
2019/04/04 10:50:00 PM AST,36,No,Yes,"That without changes to the in current use laws or significant increases in residential or commercial properties, then it will be very difficult to change the property taxes in the town of Lyme.",We like the rural character of the town and appreciate the fact that there are limited commercial properties.  The quality of the school was what made us consider Lyme in the first place and we were not disappointed in the education our children received.  We also came to Lyme knowing that it was a sending district and that our children would have the opportunity to go to Hanover high School.   We also like the many opportunities for recreation in the town of Lyme during the summer and winter.  ,"I believe that there are small opportunities for development that would improve the town of Lyme.  I do like the idea of senior housing in the town.  I would also like to see a coffee shop/sandwich shop/pizza takeout available at the town green. I could also see the town further developing it's trail systems for summer   and winter use and promoting the outdoor lifestyle that many people in the town appreciate.  Given the presence of the Green Woodlands and Dartmouth skiway and many recreation trails for skiing, snowmobiling, hiking and biking, including the AT, I don't see why the town couldn't also support a microbrewery or outdoor gear oriented business.  I also think that the town should continue to support the implementation of high speed internet in the town.  This will further enable commercial entities to consider the town for their business.  ",4,4,Too high,"I think the town should develop a plan that promotes some residential growth, fosters business activity in the town and takes advantage of our environment to bring in businesses that are consistent with the town and it's setting.  I also think the town should be more proactive in addressing changes to the in-current-use laws at the state level and/or changing state laws to allow more progressive ""use"" taxes to support town activities (e.g. Auto Registration, Costs per bag at the town dump, etc.).  I don't believe there is one answer here, but rather a lot of small changes will be required.",,I appreciate the fact that the town is actively engaged in understanding the tax revenue and expense challenges in the town.

I was disappointed in the attitude of some residents of Lyme who tried to block Bret Ryan's development along Route 10. We have an auto body shop at one end of town. So be it. We have an alternative heating company sprawled along Route 10 a bit south of that. So be it. We have an auto repair shop on Route 10 just north of the common. So be it.

New Hampshire Business Review had an interesting article recently -- https://www.nhbr.com/a-hub-for-tech-entrepreneurship/ -- that bragged about how popular the Upper Valley is for tech start-ups and medical device entrepreneurs, with most of them landing in and near Lebanon and finding it relatively easier to attract and retain qualified employees because of all the fringe benefits of moving to the Upper Valley. I think we can learn from that. For instance, think about the house for sale right now on the Common, between the library and the Consolidated Communications structure: wouldn't it make a perfect office space for a start-up or two, with all the advantages of small-town living, amazing recreational opportunities, a great elementary school and proximity to a major college with an engineering school and a first-rate medical center. Wow. We should encourage the right ""developer"" to buy that and convert it to office space, not unlike the building on the eastern end of the Common where Northern Woodlands has settled in. The Wagner building on Route 10 at the intersection of North Thetford Road is another great example of how a tax-paying business can easily fit into the corridor along Route 10, even among homes. Estes & Gallup is another great example. The Common and Route 10 should be our focus. The small house (Bill Gray) across from town hall has been for sale for a while. That, too, would be the perfect spot for the right kind of economic development -- office space for some start-ups, etc. It's quite close to Earl Strout's office park. Seems like a perfect fit. And no doubt you've already thought of all this!!",,"The town has to find ways to soften the ""control"" of the anti-development types who will simply just say no to any and all proposals. True, we have a lovely town and it's amazing to be able to take in all the beautiful farmland and forests and foothills. But that alone will not allow us to successfully attract and retain people of all economic levels. Right now the attitude seems to be to ""just say no."" And aside from the major battle that the anti-development crowd sometimes loses (Bret Ryan), that is not going to get us any form of progress. We need to encourage smart development. At this point, it seems as if that will be a very difficult objective to pull off. One last thought that was mentioned briefly in the public comment section of the presentation video: we should focus more time and effort at looking at what other towns have done to be successful in managing their growth, keeping their expenses in line and slowing the tax increases. Surely in the region, the state or in other rural areas in the Northeast, some towns have done this much better than others and we ought to be able to learn from their successes. That would definitely be worth an investment of time. But learning those answers without a change in attitude toward modest development won't get us anywhere. "

2019/04/10 4:43:46 AM AST,51,No,Yes,"I don't understand why we are pushing for further development. Having more mixed use and commercial properties would significantly alter Lyme and, in my opinion, not in a good way. I see that the town is trying to expand the tax base but I do not really agree that this is something that should be pushed.","I have lived in Lyme for 28 years. During that time the town has changed and it will certainly change in the future. But some things are the same: the rural character of the town, the natural areas interspersed between villages/neighborhoods, the long country roads, the outstanding recreation opportunities. Everyone is friendly in Lyme. We can walk around town, meet at the general store or the library, at the town beach or on a ski trail. We wave at each other when we run past an acquaintance's house. There is not a lot of traffic in Lyme - mostly on route 10, which is the only place that you really need to be careful if you are walking, running or biking, so kids can easily traipse around town to see their friends and explore this little world. There's no need for a stoplight. Life in Lyme is easy and there is a great sense of community.","Over my time living in town, the average residents have become wealthier and wealthier. I would like that the town's traditional residents are not squeezed out, and that there are more opportunities for actual real middle-class and working people to live there without needing to work at the hospital, college, or a tech company. Lyme used to be a farming community. Things change, but preserving or even re-creating more socioeconomic diversity would be great for the town in many ways.",5,5,About right,,,"I would be EXTREMELY hesitant to push further commercial development in town. There is not a need for every town to have a lot of commercial stores. At the moment, Lyme is primarily a place where people live, and where some operate their own small businesses. And that's really great!! The reality of living in Lyme would change a lot, and in my opinion for the worse, with more and bigger commercial venues. Being a primarily residential place is something that defines Lyme and makes us unique from some other towns to the south, and I think that is a benefit that draws people to live here. 

I also see that the town wants to expand their tax base, but to me any housing development that is pushed in the town should explicitly include units that make Lyme an accessible place to live for all people, not only for wealthy people who can pay a lot of taxes. Further gentrifying our town will probably only lead to more demands for more municipal services, and I see this as a runaway cycle that would lead to then another need to charge more taxes to provide these services. Thinking about the future of the town, let's think about the sense of community and how we can keep a vibrant, friendly, supportive, and resilient community, instead of just how we can make a community that pays more taxes. "
2019/04/10 8:27:55 AM AST,52,No,Yes,"The main message seemed to be that there's not much we can do, development-wise, to ease Lyme's tax burden.  That outcome, however, seems to be driven to some extent by the underlying modeling inputs, which assume a given impact (e.g., on number and ""type"" of kids, and hence school budgets, etc.) for each housing scenario.  Actual experience would suggest that real-world results can be much more volatile.  For example, just one new student who requires special services from the school (e.g., additional student aids, or even out-of-district placement) can blow up a budget and render the modeler's assumptions totally moot.  As such, ANY scenario that includes ANY sort of school-age kids is highly uncertain.  As Jeff Valence joked in the video, ""Do you feel lucky?""  In the end, I'm not sure that we can read too much into the modeling study -- except perhaps to assume that the potential downside (i.e., higher taxes from additional housing) is far greater than the potential upside.  In other words, additional development is unlikely to help taxes all that much (consistent with the modeler's results), but it could very well end up hurting taxes much more than shown in the modeling results.

Two other, more-general critiques of the modeling study:  (1) the focus on comparing Lyme to the rest of Grafton County rather than to other Upper Valley communities seemed short-sighted (I agree with Karl Furstemberg's comment to this effect); and (2) the scope of the modeling scenarios all seemed to involve either housing or retail development, and ignored other forms of potential development that could generate revenue for the town (e.g., a solar farm or something like that -- something that can generate revenue but require little or no town services).  It would have been nice to see a little more ""out of the box"" thinking along these lines, rather than focusing on only new housing or a WalMart (or a Market Basket).

At the end of the day, given that we're stuck relying on property taxes to raise revenue, and given the high percentage of property in town that is either not taxed or taxed at a very low rate, we may need to look outside of Lyme -- e.g., to Concord -- for solutions.  I agree with Jennifer Boylston's comments that we should lobby for consideration of more-equitable statewide distribution of the ""current use"" burden, or even a statewide income tax.

One other half-baked idea:  Can we convert some town roads to toll roads, at least for out-of-town users?  For example, the dirt section of Dorchester Road gets a lot of out-of-town users (e.g., traveling to Smarts Mountain or Green Woodlands) who presumably inflict quite a bit of damage to the road surface when it's soft (like in mud season).  Same with River Road, which is used by commuters to Hanover.  Lyme ends up footing the bill to keep these roads in decent shape, even though Lyme residents are probably responsible for only a fraction of the damage.  Given today's technology (e.g., EZPass, cameras, etc.), it seems like there should be a way to easily and cost-effectively collect tolls -- but is it legal?  More broadly, what about paving some of these dirt roads?
",I like Lyme's rural character and natural beauty (but would be happy to lose some of the dirt roads).  The K-8 school also fosters a nice environment for Lyme kids.,"It would obviously be nice to reduce the cost of living here!  Seeing a little more vibrancy and variety in the commercial districts (e.g., downtown, at the old Getty station, at Lyme Business Park just north of town) would make it a nicer place to live (as having to drive north or south for some basic services gets a little old).",3,4,Too high,"The increases seem too high when compared to the general rate of inflation (negligible) over this same period.  I do understand, however, that there have been some larger-than-normal road problems that have contributed to costs.  More-proactive road maintenance (e.g., I can't remember the last time our dirt road was ditched -- making it more-susceptible to washouts), or even paving some roads that are now dirt, could potentially avert some costly fixes down the road.  

If development (or at least housing/retail development, as studied) is unlikely to raise much tax revenue, then we need to sharpen our focus on costs, and cut where we can.

Finally, Lyme is also one of the wealthiest towns in the state -- how about lobbying for an income tax, which would equalize the tax burden a bit more?  Those who are wealthy will hardly notice; those who are struggling with the property tax burden because they don't have much income will presumably feel some relief.",,"Has the school board ever tried to negotiate high-school tuitions, or are we purely price-takers?  Seems like high school tuition is a large part of the school budget (though may ultimately be cheaper than having our own high school), and if these area high schools love Lyme's tuition so much, perhaps we have a little bargaining leverage we could exert?"
